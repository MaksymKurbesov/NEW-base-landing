We may suspend or terminate your rights to use the Site at any time for any reason at our sole discretion, including for any use of the Site or any Developer Tools in violation of these Terms. Upon termination of your rights under these Terms, right to access and use the Site and any Developer Tools will terminate immediately.

Even after your rights under these Terms are terminated, the following provisions of these Terms will remain in effect: Sections ‎1.5 through ‎1.10 and Sections ‎2 through ‎9 in their entirety.</li><li><strong>Dispute Resolution. </strong></li></ol><p>Please read the following arbitration agreement in this Section (the “<strong>Arbitration Agreement</strong>”) carefully. It requires you to arbitrate Disputes with Eclipse, its parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, and assigns, and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives (collectively, the “<strong>Eclipse Parties</strong>”) and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from the Eclipse Parties<em>.</em> </p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement<em>.</em></strong> You agree that any dispute between you and any of the Eclipse Parties relating in any way to the Site, the Developer Tools or any services offered on or through the Site (the “<strong>Services</strong>”), or these Terms (a “<strong>Dispute</strong>”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you and the Eclipse Parties may assert individualized claims in small claims court if the claims qualify, remain in such court, and advance solely on an individual, non-class basis; and (2) you or the Eclipse Parties may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). <strong>This Arbitration Agreement shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms and shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before you agreed to these Terms (in accordance with the preamble) or any prior version of these Terms.</strong> This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against the Eclipse Parties on your behalf. For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “<strong>Dispute</strong>” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of these Terms as well as claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms.</li><li><strong>Informal Dispute Resolution. </strong>There might be instances when a Dispute arises between you and Eclipse. If that occurs, Eclipse is committed to working with you to reach a reasonable resolution. You and Eclipse agree that good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes can result in a prompt, low‐cost, and mutually beneficial outcome. You and Eclipse therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“<strong>Informal Dispute Resolution Conference</strong>”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference.</li></ol><p>The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“<strong>Notice</strong>”), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to Eclipse that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to: legal@eclipse.xyz, or by regular mail to 4th Floor, Harbour Place, 103 South Church Street, PO Box 10240, Grand Cayman, KY1-1002 Cayman Islands. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, and mailing address; (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute. </p><p>The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. In the time between a party receiving the Notice and the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference, nothing in this Arbitration Agreement shall prohibit the parties from engaging in informal communications to resolve the initiating party’s Dispute. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.</p><ol start="3" role="list"><li><strong> Arbitration Procedure.</strong> . If the process described in subsection ‎8(b) does not resolve satisfactorily within 60 days after receipt of your Notice, you and Eclipse agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. </li></ol><p>A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “<strong>Request</strong>”). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, and e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual basis of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the process described in subsection ‎8(b); and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.  If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the Request shall also include counsel’s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email address. Such counsel must also sign the Request. </p><p>Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator appointed in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Cayman International Mediation and Arbitration Centre, as revised from time to time (<strong>&quot;CI-MAC Rules</strong>&quot;). For information on the CI-MAC Arbitration Rules, please visit <a href="https://www.caymanarbitration.com">https://www.caymanarbitration.com</a>.  If there is any inconsistency between any term of the CI-MAC Rules and any term of this Arbitration Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Use as a court would. </p><p>Unless you and Eclipse otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed in subsection <strong>‎</strong>8(h) is triggered, any arbitration hearings will be conducted in the Cayman Islands. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination will be made by CI-MAC</p><p>You and Eclipse agree that all aspects of the arbitration proceeding (including materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings), and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all parties,  and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys, accountants, or business advisors, and then subject to the condition that they agree to keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential.</p><ol start="4" role="list"><li><strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes subject to arbitration hereunder including, without limitation, any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to subsection <strong>‎</strong>8(f), including any claim that all or part of subsection <strong>‎</strong>8(f) is unenforceable, illegal, void, or voidable, or that subsection <strong>‎</strong>8(f) has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in subsection <strong>‎</strong>8(h), all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties, except as expressly provided in subsection <strong>‎</strong>8(h). The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual party under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and these Terms (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons. </li><li> <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SUBSECTION ‎8(A) YOU AND THE ECLIPSE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and the Eclipse Parties are instead electing that all covered claims and disputes shall be resolved exclusively by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in subsection ‎8(a) above. An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow these Terms as a court would. However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. </li><li><strong>Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</strong> YOU AND ECLIPSE AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SUBSECTION <strong>‎</strong>8(H) EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. Nothing in this paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under subsection ‎8(h). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this subsection ‎8(f) are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and Eclipse agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and may be litigated in the state or federal courts located in the State of California. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or Eclipse from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.</li><li><strong>Fees and Costs.</strong> </li></ol><p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “<strong>Arbitration Fees</strong>”) will be governed by the CI-MAC Rules, unless otherwise provided in this Arbitration Agreement. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in the arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose. If you or Eclipse need to invoke the authority of a court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration, then the party that obtains an order compelling arbitration in such action shall have the right to collect from the other party its reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees incurred in securing an order compelling arbitration. The prevailing party in any court action relating to whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration, including the process described in subsection ‎8(b), is entitled to recover their reasonable costs, necessary disbursements, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs.</p><ol start="8" role="list"><li><strong>Batch Arbitration.</strong> To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and Eclipse agree that in the event that there are 100 or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against Eclipse by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a 30 day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), CI-MAC shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“<strong>Batch Arbitration</strong>”).</li></ol><p>All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise CI-MAC, who shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“<strong>Administrative Arbitrator</strong>”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by Eclipse.</p><p>You and Eclipse agree to cooperate in good faith with CI-MAC to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include <em>inter alia</em> the adoption of an expedited timetable of the arbitration proceedings.</p><p>This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, and/or mass arbitration or action of any kind, or arbitration involving joint or consolidated claims under any circumstances, except as expressly set forth in this provision.</p><ol start="9" role="list"><li><strong>30-Day Right to Opt Out.</strong> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending a timely written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: 4th Floor, Harbour Place, 103 South Church Street, PO Box 10240, Grand Cayman, KY1-1002 Cayman Islands, or email to legal@eclipse.xyz, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address and a clear statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of these Terms will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have with us or may enter into in the future with us.</li><li><strong>Invalidity, Expiration.</strong> Except as provided in subsection ‎8(f), if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with Eclipse as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.</li><li><strong>Modification.</strong> Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if Eclipse makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within 30 days of such change becoming effective by writing Eclipse at the following address: 4th Floor, Harbour Place, 103 South Church Street, PO Box 10240, Grand Cayman, KY1-1002 Cayman Islands, or email to legal@eclipse.xyz. Unless you reject the change within 30 days of such change becoming effective by writing to Eclipse in accordance with the foregoing, your continued use of the Site and/or Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Site following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services or of the Site, any communications you receive, any products sold or distributed through the Site, the Services, or these Terms, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms) remain in full force and effect. Eclipse will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms. </li></ol><ol start="9" role="list"><li><strong>General</strong>some text<ol role="list"><li><strong>Governing law.  </strong>These Terms, your use of the Website and Services, your rights and obligations, and all actions contemplated by, arising out of, or related to these Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Cayman Islands, as if these Terms were a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within the Cayman Islands.  YOU AGREE THAT ALL TRANSACTIONS ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE OCCURRED IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS AND BE SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF CAYMAN ISLANDS WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PROVISIONS.
